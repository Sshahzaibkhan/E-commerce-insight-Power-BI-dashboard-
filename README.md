The Power BI project is designed to provide insights into the performance of an e-commerce store. The dashboard is created with various visualizations that depict sales data for different dimensions such as customers, states, calendar months, quarters, and product subcategories.

The first visualization presents the top customers of the e-commerce store based on their sales. It allows the user to quickly identify the most valuable customers and their purchasing behavior.

The second visualization shows the top states by sales, providing a geographical overview of the sales distribution. This visualization helps to identify the most lucrative markets for the e-commerce store and to make strategic decisions accordingly.

The third visualization displays sales by calendar months and quarters, providing a temporal overview of the sales performance. This visualization helps to identify seasonal trends and to forecast future sales based on historical data.

The fourth visualization depicts the subcategories of products and their sale percentages. This visualization provides insights into the product categories that are performing well and those that need improvement.

The final visualization focuses on the subcategories of products that generate more profits. It helps to identify the most profitable product categories and to optimize the product mix accordingly.

Overall, the Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the e-commerce store's performance, enabling the user to make informed decisions and take actions to improve sales and profits.
